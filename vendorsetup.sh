 #- Set this to 1 to enable support for Realme oZip decryption
 #- do not use this unless you know what you are doing (see below)
 #- if this is enabled, you must also set "TW_OZIP_DECRYPT_KEY"
 #- Note: This is NOT required for realme devices that are released with android 10 or above, since realme has added 
 #- the decryptor inside of the updater binary removing the necessity for an external decryptor. For devices that
 #- are updated to android 10, this feature is necessary only for downgrades to pie or below.
